# klipper

This module installs and does a baseline configuration of [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)

## Usage

For the most basic usage, just include the base klipper class. This will install
and configure klipper using the standard defaults for a Raspbian system.

## Limitations

This module is pretty limited at the moment. It does the baseline install and service management
makes sure necessary paths and files are present, but it doesn't currently have the ability to
manage actual printer configuration.
